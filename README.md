# School District Analysis
## This report will help evaluate the math and reading testing grade levels of a local school district.
### Overview of School District Analysis.
The Analysis includes small and large schools from both public and charter schools in the area. The main areas of concern for the focus of this study is to determine the passing percentage of the different schools in the math and reading, catagories. As such, we have taken a look at the different factors that go into making a particualr school more or less likely to pass standarized reading and math test at a proffecient level. Some of the factors we took into consideration for this study are...

- School Name
- School Size
- Grade Level
- Gender
- Type of school
- Budget 
- Math Scores
- Reading Scores
- Overall Passing **%**

The idea behind the analysis was to see if there exists a correlation between class size and passing percentage and also to investigate if the amount of money budgeted per student also helps to increase or decrease the likelyhood of a particualr student passing the tests with high averages. 

### Results
During our research for the analysis it came to our attention that some students at a particular high school of a particular grade level were accused of cheating and it was tasked upon us to remove the affected students records from the summary and analysis. As such, the follwing description of the results of our investigation will focus primarly on the integrated results of the affected students math and reading scores having been stricken from the offical analysis.
